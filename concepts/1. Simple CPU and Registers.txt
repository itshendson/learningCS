Combination Circuits - Where an output is based ONLY on a present input. Combination circuit uses static information.

Sequential Circuits - Where an output is based on both an present input AND a previous output. Because there is a previous output, memory is needed to store that previous output. Sequential Circuits uses dynamic information. The input comes from a register. The output comes out to the same register. 

There is also a third input, called F. F is a number that selects one of several functions. For example F= 4 could mean A + B. F = 3 could mean A * B.

Clock - Determines when a circuit executes. Clocks have ticks (usually the rising edge) that goes from low to high repeatedly at a frequency. There are many signals/inputs that goes to the circuit. We don't want these signals/inputs to be executed randomly. The clock regulates that to ensure there is order and sequence to these signals/inputs.  

Memory - Short term storage. Data is wiped when computer shuts off (eg. RAM). Memory can be thought of as a long tape of bytes. Each byte has an address. The address is just an integer (eg. 132)

Storage - Persistent storage of data that exists even after computer is turned off (eg. writing on discs, hard drive, SSDs)

Bit is a 1 or 0. Every integers (eg. 1, 238, -71, etc) can be represented by 32 bits.

Byes is 8 bits. Since it takes 32 bits to represent an integer and it takes 8 bits to represent a byte. An integer also represents 4 bytes. 

Array of Integers - if you have an array of length 3, you basically need 3 bytes stored in memory.
