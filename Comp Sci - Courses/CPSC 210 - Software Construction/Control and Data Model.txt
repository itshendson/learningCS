• Control Flow and Data Model
- Purpose is to help Developers comprehend source code

• Control Flow
- The order in which code executes
- When we only consider how code flows within a method it is called "intra-method control flow"
- When one method calls another method, it is called "inter-method control flow"


• Words Irregardless of Language
- Different programming languages have different words to describe the same concept
- Here is a list of words you can use regardless of language:
- Operation : Method
- Modules : Class

• Coupling
- When modules are interdependent on each other
- Greater coupling decreases modularity (bad) and makes the system more complex
- We want to decrease coupling
- In general, we only want one path between two classes

• Cohesion
- Describes whether functionality in a module are related and focused
- You want every functionality in a class to be RELEVANT to the class
- If there are alot of unrelated functionality in a class, it has LOW cohesion
