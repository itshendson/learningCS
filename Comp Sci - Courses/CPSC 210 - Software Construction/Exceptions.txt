• Exception
- An event that interrupts the flow

• Class Hierarchy
- Throwable is the root class of every error and exception

• Checked Exceptions
- Represents a potential problem that the user knows can happen...
- so you declare the exception in the method signature and create a handling policy at compile time.
- Checked Exceptions must declare the exception type in the method signature
- If the exception is declared but not handled in a method, the exception goes back to the caller of the method

- Example:
public int nthDayInYear(int year, int monoth, int day) throws IllegalValueException {
	if (year <= 0) {
		throw new IllegalValueException("Year is <=0");
	...



• Runtime (Unchecked) Exceptions
- Represents an unexpected problem at runtime (eg. nullpointerexception, illegalargumentexception)
- An exceptional condition that may occur anywhere in the program (eg. Java ran out of memory). 
- Unlike checked exceptions, the method need not declare it can throw an unchecked exception.

- Example:
public BankAccount(String owner, int amount) {
	if (amount < 0) {
		throw new RuntimeException("Cannot create account with negative balance")
	}
	...

- The above method will not throw an error until the program is RUNNING. 



• User-defined Exceptions
- You can define your own exceptions by extending a class to either Exception or RuntimeException
