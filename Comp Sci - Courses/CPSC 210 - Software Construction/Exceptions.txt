• Checked Exceptions
- A Checked exception are ones that are thrown in a method that must either be caught and handled within the method, or 
the method must declare that it can throw the checked exception

- Example:
public int nthDayInYear(int year, int monoth, int day) throws IllegalValueException {
	if (year <= 0) {
		throw new IllegalValueException("Year is <=0");
	...

• Runtime (Unchecked) Exceptions
- An exceptional condition that may occur anywhere in the program (eg. Java ran out of memory). 
- Unlike checked exceptions, the method need not declare it can throw an unchecked exception.


• User-defined Exceptions
- You can define your own exceptions by extending a class to either Exception or RuntimeException
