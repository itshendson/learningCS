• How do we measure the space and time of an algorithm, given that different computers have different hardware?

• Asymptotic Notation
- What happens to speed/time of an algo as n approaches infinity.

• Notations
Big O = Upper Bound: n = O(n^2)
Theta = Tight Bound: n < 3n < 5n: 3n is tightly bound between two bounds
Omega = Lower Bound: n^3=o(log(n)):
