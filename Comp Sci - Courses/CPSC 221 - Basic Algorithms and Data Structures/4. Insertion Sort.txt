â€¢ Insertion Sort
- Another algorithm
- Takes elements of an array and inserts it into another "sorted" array
- The algo is fastest when the unsorted array is already in the correct order
- The worst case scenario is when the unsorted array is in reverse order, thereby having to change every element O(n^2)
