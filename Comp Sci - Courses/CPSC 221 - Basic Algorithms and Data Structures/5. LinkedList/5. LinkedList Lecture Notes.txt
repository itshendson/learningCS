â€¢ Linked List
- Each element is a node that contains 2 things: the value and an address that points to the next node
- Unlike Insertion Sort and Selection Sort, LinkedList allows us to insert/delete data much faster
- Nodes are created in dynamic memory
- The last pointer in the linkedlist points to null. Node(7, null)
- We can insert node at the back of list in O(1) time!
- LinkedList requires more pointer 
- Every node knows the previous and next node
