Static Control Flow decides the sequence of activities/steps that will be executed when running a Java class.

1. Identification of static members from top to bottom. All the static variables, methods, and blocks are identified during this step.
2. Execution of static variable assignments and static blocks from top to bottom.
3. Finally, the static main method is executed in the last step of static control flow.
