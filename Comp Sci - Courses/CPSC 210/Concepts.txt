â€¢ Data Abstraction
- Putting the "wires" of a machine inside a black box to hide them 
- We only need need to know the inputs and outputs of said black box
- As long as we know the specifications (inputs/outputs/parameters/method signature) of a black box, we can connect it to other systems
- The other systems will still work despite the fact it doesn't know whats inside the black box
- This enables "modularity" and all its benefits (ie. easily isolating a problematic system, easily replacing the broken module, if a module break it won't break the entire system)
