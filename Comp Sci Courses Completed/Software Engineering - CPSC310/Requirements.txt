Requirements is how engineers understand the customer.

â€¢ This is iterative process where steps can go back and forth.
1. Elicitation: The gathering and discovery of requirements from stakeholders
2. Analysis: Logical breakdown of elicitation to get richer/more precise understanding of requirements
3. Specification: Representing the collected requirements knowledge in a document
4. Validation: Go to the customer to get their feedback/review then go back to step 1.
