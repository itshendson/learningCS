• Linked List Structure
- Each element is a node that contains 2 things: the value and an address that points to the next node
- The last pointer in the linkedlist points to null. Node(7, null)
- LinkedList requires more pointer than other data structure
- Every node knows the previous node and next node

• Performance
- Unlike Insertion Sort and Selection Sort, LinkedList allows us to insert/delete data much faster
- Nodes are created in dynamic memory
- We can insert node at the back of list in O(1) time!

• Operations
- Insertion: change pointer of one node to the inserted node. The inserted node points to the next node
- Removal: change pointer of one node to the next node in the series (unlinking a node does not mean that unlinked node has been deleted)
