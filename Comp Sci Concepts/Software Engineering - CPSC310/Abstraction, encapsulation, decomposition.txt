• Purpose of Abstraction
- Allow Software Engineers to focus on just the key information
- If talking with UX Designer, viewpoint shifts
- If talking with QA, talking in more details
- Level of abstraction changes depending on who you're talking to/which stakeholder you're talking to

• Decomposition
- Break down high-level complex description into smaller manageable pieces

• Encapsulation
- Enables abstraction through the use of interface
- Encapsulate data and behaviour of a class and separate it from its implementation

• Information Hiding
- Hide specific details about implementation from the high-level interface
- Separates that which varies (the implementation) from what stays the same (method names)
