• Waterfall
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Verification
5. Maintenance

- Each step has extremely clear hand-offs between stakeholders (PM -> DEVs -> Implementation)
- Weakness: Extreme pushback against revisting a prior phase/inflexible


• Agile
- The idea is to let development teams rapidly and flexibly produce software systems.
- Agile is designed to foster increased customer interaction within a software system
- Idea is to spend less time building the wrong thing and let engineers try different design alternatives
- Agile approaches used by teams who need to frequently deploy their systems (eg. continuous deployment techniques)

- Individuals and interactiosn over processess and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to changes over following a plan


• Scrum
1. Product Backlog
2. Planning
3. Spring Backlog
4. Sprint

- An incremental iteration-based methodology that breaks work into fixed-length sprints (1 - 3 weeks). Code is shippable after each sprint
