• B-Tree Definitions
- Values are now called KEYS
- B Trees also have an "Order M"
- Order M means that a node can have at most M amount of children

• B-Tree Structures
- Nodes can have multiple values/keys, not just 1 like BST
- Nodeshave can have multiple branches
- A non-leaf node with k children, contains k-1 keys
- The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node
- Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least m/2 children
- All leaves appear in the same level 

• Insertion
- Insert until node full, then split (2 keys to a "left" node, the 3rd key promoted to parent node, then other keys on the right node)
