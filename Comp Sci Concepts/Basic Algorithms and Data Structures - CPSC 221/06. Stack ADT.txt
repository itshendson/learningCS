• Stack Data Structure
- Only allows items to be inserted/removed at one end (the top)
- The other end is called the bottom
- Order of stack based on order in which they arrive
- LIFO

• Stack Behaviour
- Push: insert item to top of stack
- Pop: remove and return the top item
- Peek: return the top item
- Is_empty: does stack contain items

• Implementation
- Can be implemented by Linked lists, Arrays, and others

- Arrays: When implementing by arrays, need to keep track of the index that represents the top
- When we insert an item, increment this index
- When we remove an item, decrement this index
- Insertion or deletion time is independent of the number of items in the stack

- Dynamic Arrays:
- Push and pop performed in constant time
- Can design a dynamic array stack such that when it is full either:
	- No new values can be inserted, or
	- a new, larger array can be created (linear time)

- Linked List:
- Push and pop simplyu call insert or remove from front of list
- All operations O(1)
