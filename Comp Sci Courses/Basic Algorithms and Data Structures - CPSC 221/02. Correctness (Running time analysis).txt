• General Rules:
- Single operations: constant time
- Consecutive operations: sum of operation time
- Conditionals: condition check + branch time
- Loops: sum of each loop body
- Function call: time for function

• Loop invariants
- If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration
- Properties of the algo that are always true/do not vary any point in the program
- A property may change briefly but the rest of the loop instructions should return the property for
	the next iteration
