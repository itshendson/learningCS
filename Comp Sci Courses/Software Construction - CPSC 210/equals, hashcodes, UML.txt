• Bunch of UML stuff that I won't remember but will learn in the future

• Overriding equals
- Apparently it is common practice to override the equals() method.
- The equals method extends the object class
- the equals method doesn't do what you think it does. It is actually comparing location in memory
- We want the equals method to compare whether two objects have the same content
- Therefore we have to override the equals method

- If you override equals you have to ensure 3 things:
1. the object is equal to itself
2. the object is not null
3. the instances are from the same class

- If we do it right, then the equals method should do the following:

String s = new String(“a”);
String t = new String (“a”);
s == t; // is false
s.equals(t); // is true


- If you override equals, you must override hashcodes

• Overriding hashcodes
- Every object has an integer
- If two objects have the same hashcode they are equal
