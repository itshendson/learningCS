The purpose of this mini project is to practice the things that I have learned so far. The concepts I want to practice are:
- Abstract Class (extends)
- Interface (implements)
- Data Abstraction
- Mutability best practice
- Objects
- Weakening the the pre-condition
- Strengthening the post-condition
- helper


Ideas:
- Microwave?
- Pokemon?
- Stormtroopers? (too esoteric)
- Social Media engagements (likes, shares)
- Animals (already overdone)
- Banking (savings, chequing, investment)
- Shops inside video games
- Cars


Step 1: Abstracting vehicles:

• Types of vehicles?
sedans, motorcycle, plane, boat, truck

• Properties of vehicles
wheels, fuel, doors, weight, engine, hauling capacity, seats, medium of travel (eg. water, land, air), brand, acceleration, tank capacity, color, brand,

• Properties unique to sedan

• Properties unique to motorcycle

• Properties unique to plane

• Properties unique to boat

• Properties unique to truck
