The purpose of this mini project is to practice the things that I have learned so far. The concepts I want to practice are:
- Abstract Class (extends)
- Interface (implements)
- Data Abstraction
- Mutability best practice
- Objects
- Weakening the the pre-condition
- Strengthening the post-condition
- helper


I am abstracting the Bank of Montreal's product lines. The Bank of Montreal have several products including a chequing account, savings, accounts, investment accounts, and more.
